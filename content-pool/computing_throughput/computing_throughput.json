    "body": "Consider the scenario shown below, with four different servers connected to four different clients over four three-hop paths. The four pairs share a common middle hop with a transmission capacity of R = 300 Mbps. The four links from the servers to the shared link have a transmission capacity of RS = 50 Mbps. Each of the four links from the shared middle link to a client has a transmission capacity of RC = 90 Mbps.\n\nWhat is the maximum achievable end-end throughput (an integer value, in Mbps) for each of four client-to-server pairs, assuming that the middle link is fairly shared (divides its transmission rate equally) and all servers are trying to send at their maximum rate?\nYour answer: [A] Mbps \\n##1.4.7.png##",
