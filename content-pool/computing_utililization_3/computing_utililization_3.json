    "body": "Consider the scenario shown below, with four different servers connected to four different clients over four three-hop paths. The four pairs share a common middle hop with a transmission capacity of R = 300 Mbps. The four links from the servers to the shared link have a transmission capacity of RS = 50 Mbps. Each of the four links from the shared middle link to a client has a transmission capacity of RC = 90 Mbps.\n\nAssuming that the servers are all sending at their maximum rate possible, what are the link utilizations of the client links (with transmission capacity RC)? Enter your answer in a decimal form of 1.00 (if the utilization is 1) or 0.xx (if the utilization is less than 1, rounded to the closest xx).\n\n\nYour answer: The utilization of client link is: [A] \\n##1.4.7.png##",
