Handles protocols like HTTP, FTP, and DNS.\n\nTransport Layer \u2013 responsible for process-to-process communication, ensuring reliable or best-effort data transfer between programs on different hosts (e.g., TCP, UDP).\n\nNetwork Layer \u2013 delivers packets/datagrams from a source host to a destination host across multiple networks (e.g., IP).\n\nLink Layer \u2013 transfers data between neighboring devices over a single network link.\n\nPhysical Layer \u2013 moves bits into and out of the physical transmission medium (e.g., electrical, optical, or radio signals).",
